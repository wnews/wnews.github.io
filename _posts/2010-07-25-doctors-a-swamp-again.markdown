  content: Thank you for your response, as we are a volunteer run organisation, we
    appreciate all feedback and information.  This is a service advertisement that
    is routine placed and until now it hadn't been picked up.  I think we were all
    expecting new doctors to come in and resume practising, but unfortunately that
    hasn't happened.  This service information has now been updated and thank you
    for bringing it to our attention.
